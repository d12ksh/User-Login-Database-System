Frontend: [e.g. Tkinter and python L systems]
Database: [e.g. MySQL]
Authentication: [e.g. bcrypt for password hashing]

# Usage and Structure
(Python) Integrate both signuo and signin files in a zipped common path folder, make a change in directory code to implement and run.
(MySQL) Add same database as used and use mysql command client to serve you better.
